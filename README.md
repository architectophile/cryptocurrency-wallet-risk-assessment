# Quantitative Risk Assessment on Decentralized Cryptocurrency Wallet Using Bayesian Network

### Abstract

Since the creation of the first Bitcoin blockchain in 2009, the number of cryptocurrency users has steadily increased. However, the number of hacking attacks targeting assets stored in these usersâ€™ cryptocurrency wallets is also increasing. Therefore, we evaluate the security of the wallets currently on the market to ensure that they are safe. We first conduct threat modeling to identify threats to cryptocurrency wallets and identify the security requirements. Second, based on the derived security requirements, we utilize attack trees and Bayesian network analysis to quantitatively measure the risks inherent in each wallet and compare them. According to the results, the average total risk in software wallets is 1.22 times greater than that in hardware wallets. In the comparison of different hardware wallets, we found that the total risk inherent to the Trezor One wallet, which has a general-purpose MCU, is 1.11 times greater than that of the Ledger Nano S wallet, which has a secure element. However, use of a secure element in a cryptocurrency wallet has been shown to be less effective at reducing risks.
