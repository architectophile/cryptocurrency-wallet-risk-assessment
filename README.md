# Quantitative Risk Assessment on Decentralized Cryptocurrency Wallet Using Bayesian Network

### Abstract

Since the creation of the first Bitcoin blockchain in 2009, cryptocurrency users have been steadily increasing. However, hacking attacks targeting assets stored in these usersâ€™ cryptocurrency wallets are also increasing. Therefore, we evaluate the security of the wallets on the market to ensure that they are safely made. We first conduct threat modeling to identify threats present in cryptocurrency wallets and derive security requirements. Secondly, based on the derived security requirements, we utilize attack tree and Bayesian network to quantitatively measure the risks inherent in each wallet and compare them. According to the results, the average total risk in software wallets is 1.22 times higher than hardware wallets. And in the hardware wallet comparison, we found that the total risk in a Trezor One wallet which has a general-purpose MCU is 1.11 times higher than a Ledger Nano S wallet which has a secure element. However, using a secure element has been shown to be relatively less effective in reducing risks in a cryptocurrency wallet.
